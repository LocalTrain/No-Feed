No-Feed
=======

Chrome Extension which hides all your Facebook news feed.

If you don't want to see any feed in your me/home, you can use this extension, to hide all the content.

Hide your Facebook news feed if you want to increase your productivity, or if you are engaged in some important activity and your Facebook news feed is distracting you.

###How To Use

I have not added this to Chrome store, as it is still in it's Beta phase. Follow below steps to use it :

1. Download it from [here] (https://github.com/tapasweni-pathak/No-Feed/blob/master/dist/NoFeed.zip?raw=true) and extract/unzip it.
2. Either go to chrome://extensions or go to Tools -> Extensions.
3. Check Developer Mode is ticked.
4. Click on Load unpacked extension, go to the location where you downloaded it in step 1.
5. You are done.
